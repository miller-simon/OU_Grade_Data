This is Simon Miller's final project for MIS 4470. To get it to 
compile, simply open the .Rproj then elect to compile.

The data used from this project was provided by Oakland
Univerisity's Office of Institutional Research and Assessment.
Some of it was available on the MySail website, while other files
were provided after request.

There are essentially 3 sections to the project:

1. EDA for the given data sets
2. Predictive modeling with the dependent variable, enrollment by 
department
3. Developing and testing a bootstrap aggregation function, with
application to the above regression problem
